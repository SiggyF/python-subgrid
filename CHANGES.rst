Changelog of python-subgrid
===================================================


0.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- If the models aren't available, the functional model tests are skipped. This
  makes for quicker tests if you want to test just the internal unittests.

- Modified library loading routine to automatically look in a couple of
  standard locations, amongst them ``/opt/3di/``.

- Added code from the previous ``python_wrapper`` directory.

- Initial project structure created with nensskel 1.33.dev0.
